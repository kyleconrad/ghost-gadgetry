## Customization

### Blog Cover

The main blog cover image you upload should work both as vertical sliced image, and a horizontal banner image. Gadgetry seamlessly switches between the two in it's adapative design.

### Blog Logo

The blog logo image you upload will appear above the social media icons and buttons. The left column is 410px wide. We recommend logos to be less than that. 

### Social Media Icons

To add your social media accounts beneath the logo, you'll need to open up ./gadgetry/default.hbs and change the value of the href attribute from '#' to the URL corresponding to your social media account. 

Each social media link is assigned a class which determines which social media icon will be used for that link. Supported class names are:

* icon-github
* icon-dribble
* icon-feed
* icon-twitter
* icon-facebook
* icon-flickr
* icon-vimeo
* icon-tumblr
* icon-youtube
* icon-soundcloud
* icon-pinterest
* icon-googleplus
* icon-linkedin
* icon-behance
* icon-instagram
* icon-spotify
